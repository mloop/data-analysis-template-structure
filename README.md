# Data analysis repository template

All data analyses have many different files. But keeping track of them can be hard. This template repository serves as "best practices" for our research group. All data analysis projects should use this repository as a starting point.

Because you cannot have empty directories in a `git` repository, this repository doesn't show the full collection of files you should have. The full collection of files should be

```
| data/
  | raw/
  | cleaned/
| output/
| figs/
| reports/
| scripts/
  | functions/
```

If your repository does not look like this, I will be asking you to modify it to be in this format. Therefore, it's easier to start off with this first! :grimacing:
